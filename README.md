Project Title - Image Cartoonifier

In week 1, python libraries, specifically pandas and the various functions in pandas to work with datasets in csv files were introduced. The assignment had a challenging problem regarding the olch of stock prices, which was fun to solve.                                                
In week 2, the focus was introduction to machine learning through the online course offered by deeplearning.ai, instructed by Andrew NG. Gradient descent algorithms, linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests were some key concepts in this week. The python library, scikit-learn is used extensively in the assignment.                 
In week 3 - present, advanced machine learning concepts like nueral netwoks, activation functions, forward and backward propagation, convolutional nueral networks and computer vision, are the focus. TensorFlow library is also introduced through the courses. The CourseEra courses in the Deep Learning Specialization offered by Andrew NG have been advised by the mentor. The assignment would be released at the end of the week.
In the subsquent weeks, the main focus was on the assignment to recognize digits using the digit_recognizer_dataset, using only Numpy and Pandas to get a feel for the activation functions, forward prop and back prop.
Pytorch was next introduced and the resources were shared to practice problems in Pytorch.
Next, the main focus of the project, Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style, was shared which had theory regarding the content and style reconstructions and the cost function used.
